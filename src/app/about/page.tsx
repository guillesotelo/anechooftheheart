            Some years ago, as I slowed down and quieted my life, an inward and spiritual search sparked within me, deeper than ever before. I began connecting with the words of mentors, books, and inspiring people, while also learning to truly listen to my own thoughts and feelings. That quiet shift became a profound turning point in my life.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            Writing soon became my way of making sense of the changes; expressing inner transformation, motherhood, creativity, and the evolving nature of self. As I began sharing my reflections, I noticed something beautiful: a bridge was forming. My words were not just mine; they resonated with others, creating connection, understanding, and even healing. That's when I understood the quiet power of storytelling, and how one person's truth can echo outward and touch many.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            I never imagined how much joy, creativity, change, healing, and personal growth I would discover through writing and sharing.

            An Echo of the Heart is my evolving side project, an honest space for reflection, creativity, and presence. Here, I write freely and intuitively, exploring moments from motherhood, expat life, personal spirituality, and travel, alongside my creative business, Bespoken, which allows me to express beauty through handcrafted florals and gifts.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            Whether you're here to read, reflect, or simply take a breath, I hope this space feels like a soft landing. I'm not always consistent, as a mom and woman continually learning, I've embraced the free flow. I return here when I can, trying to let go of perfection and taking each step slowly, with intention.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            Thank you for being here. May something you read echo back into your own heart, reminding you to live gently, creatively, and fully.

          <p style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Hi, I'm Dany García! Welcome to this online space where I share stories from my life, writing about motherhood, travel, self-discovery, and the creative journey of personal growth.</p>
          <p>I was born in Colombia, spent part of my childhood in the U.S., lived over a decade in Argentina, and now find myself way up north in Scandinavia. I’m mom to little Benja, wife to Guille, and dog mama to our energetic Jack Russell, Indie.</p>
          <p>My path has taken me through many cultures and life stages. I've always been someone who celebrates life’s everyday moments; through dance, gatherings with friends and family, and now, through writing. My professional background is in Hospitality Management, where I worked in guest and employee services for hotels and companies, cultivating deep human connection. I carry those experiences with joy and gratitude.</p>
          <p>Later, I followed a creative calling and started Bespoken, my dream business in Buenos Aires, crafting adornments, gifts, and floral designs. Life shifted again when we moved to Sweden, and I embraced my role as a full-time mother. Through all these transitions, writing became a way to explore, reflect, and stay rooted.</p>
          <p><i>An Echo of the Heart</i> is my evolving creative space, where I explore the beauty and challenges of motherhood, expat life, inner transformation, and inspired living. I believe change is always with us, and while we constantly evolve, we also carry within us the seed of everything we are meant to be.</p>
          <p>In a world full of noise and comparison, it’s easy to question our journey. But as Marshall Rosenberg said, <i>“Judgment is the enemy of compassion.”</i> True compassion begins when we observe ourselves without judgment.</p>
          <p>Like an oak tree growing from a small seed, our potential lives within us. My intention is to live each day with truth, compassion, and freedom; to be fearless in my self-expression and gentle with myself and others.</p>
          <p>It took me years to bring this blog to life. And in that time, I learned a few truths:</p>
          <p><strong>1)</strong> You can go at your own pace. Life doesn’t need to be rushed, tiny steps count.</p>
          <p><strong>2)</strong> Life is meant to be enjoyed, not evaluated. The present moment is where real life happens.</p>
          <p><strong>3)</strong> Your voice matters. Let others inspire you, but always come back to your unique story.</p>
          <p><strong>4)</strong> Forgiveness is daily work. It clears the way for deeper growth and connection.</p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>I hope this space inspires you to reflect, create, and reconnect with your own voice. You hold within you everything you need to grow and become.</p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '3rem' }}>With love,</p>
